# Tic Tac Toe Game in Python

## Introduction
This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game implemented in Python. The game allows two players to take turns and play on a 3x3 board. It checks for a winner after every move and declares a winner or a draw accordingly.

## Features
- Two-player game.
- Simple CLI interface.
- Checks for winning conditions dynamically.
- Error handling for invalid moves.

## Prerequisites

   ```

2. **Run the script**
   ```sh
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

## How to Play
- The game is played on a **3x3 grid**.
- Player **X** always goes first.
- Players take turns entering a number (1-9) to place their mark on the board.
- The first player to form a row, column, or diagonal of their marks wins.
- If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Example Gameplay
